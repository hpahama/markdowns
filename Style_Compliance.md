Main repo to check: https://github.com/vcd2df/r
Style Guide: https://style.tidyverse.org/
VCD files: https://github.com/vcd2df/vcd_ex

Importance of a style guide:
Ensures that code is consistent, readable, and maintainable. [Especially when working with collaborative projects or submitting pakcages to repositories like CRAN]

1. Improves Readability
- Makes it easier for others and you to understand and review the code.
- Clear formatting and process simplification
2. Enhances Maintainability
- Helps avoid consistencies
- Contributors can modify code without introducing conflicting styles
3. Facilitates Collaboration
- Reduces confusion when reading or integrating code written by others
4. Encourages Best Practices
- Enforces good habits
5. Ensures CRAN Compliance

Steps:
1. Read/Skim through the Style Guide [https://style.tidyverse.org/]
- Realised I won't have to check the code line by line, and would only have to utilize the packages available to accomplish task.
- "making code easier to write because you need to make fewer decisions."
- Two Packages: styler, lintr
- At this point I don't know where to begin, so I open the Repo Guide I created and started with <code>R/vcd2df.R</code>
- Maybe I'm a little bit confused about what I am supposed to accomplish here. 

Notes:
- The File naming choices are quite reasonable and human readable
-
